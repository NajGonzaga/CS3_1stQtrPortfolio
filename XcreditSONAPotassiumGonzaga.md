3. Many flood control projects **FAILED**.

### Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason (explaining is optional)

1. **Making ALL rice, including high-quality ones, cost 20 pesos per 1 kilogram.**
2. **"To those who are stealing or not making propoer use of funds for the nation, mahiya naman kayo sa kapwa niyo Pilipino"**,

### Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)

After watching the SONA 2025, It was obvious that the government officials wanted to improve on strengthening our economy. BBM stated that he wanted developments in infractructure, education, and healthcare to create long-term growth. Another notable point in SONA was the digital transformation, wherein govenment services will be enhanced and connections to rural areas will be improved, helping bridge gaps in growaccess and oppurtunity. These projects will surely improve the quality of life in our country if effectively implemented. 

Though these projects look promising and reassuring, it also left some concerns. While the speech was full of promises, issues like corruption and transparency weren't fully addressed. These two are important for good governance and public trust, without those, the plans promised to us could fail because of the lack of accountability. Overall, SONA is somehow promising, but consistent efforts and public support will make these projects even more promising and long-lasting.


### What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?

A lot of promises being said but is not being consistently done or is ghosted.
