## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Input and output statements** are used to interact with the user in a program. The input function allows the program to receive data from the user, usually in the form of text, which can then be stored in a variable. The print function displays information or results back to the user. Together, they make a program interactive by enabling communication between the user and the computer.

2. **If statements** are decision-making tools in programming that allow the computer to run code only when a condition is true. An **if-else statement** adds an alternative path, so if the condition is false, a different block of code runs instead. This creates branching logic that makes programs flexible and able to react to different inputs. For example, a program can check if a number is positive or negative and respond accordingly.

3. The **break function** is used to exit a loop before it has finished all of its iterations. It is often combined with if conditions to stop the loop when a certain event occurs. For example, in a while loop that asks for a password, the break statement can end the loop once the correct password is entered. This makes programs more efficient and responsive to specific conditions.

4. **Arithmetic operations** include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), and exponentiation (**). These operations allow programmers to perform mathematical calculations on variables and values. For example, they can be used to calculate averages, solve equations, or process user input into meaningful results. Arithmetic operators are the building blocks of most problem-solving in coding.

5. **Logical operations**, such as and, or, and not, are used to combine or modify conditions in decision-making statements. They return Boolean values (True or False), which determine the flow of a program. For example, an if statement can check whether two conditions are true at the same time using and, or whether at least one condition is true using or. Logical operations allow programmers to create complex conditions for more precise control over their programs.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. A **while loop** repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains true. It is useful when we don’t know ahead of time how many times the loop should run. I need more practice with while loops because sometimes I forget to update the condition inside the loop, which can cause infinite loops. Understanding how to manage loop control more carefully would make my programs more efficient.

2. A **do-while loop** is similar to a while loop, but it always runs at least once before checking the condition. This is helpful when input or calculations need to be executed first. I need further discussion about do-while loops because they are not always supported in every language, and I sometimes confuse when to use them instead of a while loop. More practice would help me identify real-life situations where this loop is best.

3. A **for loop** is often used when the number of iterations is already known, such as going through a list or repeating a task a set number of times. It has an initialization, a condition, and an increment/decrement part. I still need practice with for loops because I sometimes mix up the syntax or forget how to properly use them with arrays and ranges. More examples could help me become more comfortable using them in different scenarios.

4. A **switch statement** allows a program to choose one block of code to execute from several options, based on the value of a variable or expression. It is cleaner and easier to read than writing many if-else statements. I need further discussion on switch functions because I get confused about when a break is needed and how cases “fall through” if it is missing. Practicing with more complex examples would help me understand how to use switch more effectively.

5. A **nested loop** is when one loop is placed inside another, and it is often used for tasks like working with grids, tables, or multi-dimensional data. It can be powerful but also complicated because each iteration of the outer loop triggers all the iterations of the inner loop. I need more practice with nested loops because it can be hard to track how many times the inner loop runs overall, and I sometimes struggle with performance issues or logic errors. Working through real examples, like matrix problems, would make this clearer.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. **While Loop**: To strengthen my understanding of while loops, I plan to practice by writing small programs where the loop stops based on user input, like guessing games. I will also review examples from class and pay close attention to updating the condition so I don’t accidentally create infinite loops.

2. **Do-While Loop**: Since do-while loops always run at least once, I will focus on creating programs that need this structure, like input validation exercises. I will compare them side by side with while loops to clearly see the difference in their behavior. This practice will help me remember when to use one over the other.

3. **For Loop**: To become more confident with for loops, I plan to practice with arrays, ranges, and counters. I will write simple programs that repeat tasks a set number of times, like printing multiplication tables. By doing this repeatedly, I can get more comfortable with the syntax and logic of for loops.

4. **Switch Functions**: My plan is to study switch statements by creating programs with multiple options, such as a calculator or a simple menu system. I will pay special attention to the placement of break statements to avoid fall-through errors. With repeated practice, I will better understand how switch cases are structured.

5. **Nested Loop**: Since nested loops can be tricky, I will practice them by working on problems involving patterns, grids, or simple matrix operations. I will carefully trace the output step by step to see how the inner and outer loops interact. This will help me build confidence in understanding how many times loops run in combination.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

#### Effective

- Instructor demonstrations were very effective because watching the teacher code step by step helped me see how concepts actually worked in practice. It gave me a clear model to follow and made abstract ideas easier to understand.

- Another activity that helped me a lot was the group discussions and problem-solving tasks. Working with classmates gave me the chance to share ideas and also hear different approaches to the same problem. Sometimes, a classmate would explain a loop or condition in a simpler way that really clicked for me. I also noticed that when I explained my own reasoning to others, it reinforced my understanding because I had to think carefully about why the code worked.

#### Less effective

- One activity that I didn’t find as effective was when we had long lectures without immediate practice. I often felt like I understood the concept while the teacher was explaining it, but once the lecture ended, I struggled to apply it on my own. Without coding right away, it was easy to forget the details or mix up the syntax. I realized that I learn better when I can try out examples as soon as possible after hearing about them.

- Fast-paced lessons were less effective because the material often moved on before I fully understood the previous concept. This made it hard to keep up and left me feeling behind at times.
